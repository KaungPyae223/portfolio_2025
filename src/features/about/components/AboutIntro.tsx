          <span className="ms-20"></span>Hi my name is Kaung Pyae Aung and
          currently finished the Bachelor of Computing in University of
          Greenwich. I also have completed the NCC Level 5, Level 4. I have
          focused on full stack web development, starting my studies at MMSIT,
          2023. I also have an work experience from MMSIT work shop program
          under the control of Sayar Hein Htet Zan.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mt-10 mb-5">
          <span className="ms-20"></span>Throughout my developer journey, I have
          worked on various assignments, self-initiated projects, 
          workshop programs and gaining practical experience in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React, Next.js and Laravel. While I
          acknowledge that my current coding practices need refinement to meet
          real-world standards, I am eager to improve through junior positions
          or internships. I am passionate about learning and tackling new
          challenges, continually striving to create and innovate.
